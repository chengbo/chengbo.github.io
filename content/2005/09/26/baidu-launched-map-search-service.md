title: Baidu launched Map Search Service
---

Baidu launched an online map service through a partnership with online map service provider Mapbar. Mapbar is similar to Google's map service. Baidu has designated several URL's for its map service, including map.baidu.com, maps.baidu.com, ditu.baidu.com and baidu.mapbar.com. The map search service now is not powerful enough. It just has provided maps of ten cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan and Xi'an. It caused me a little disappointment that Chengdu wasn't in the list. Hope it can do even better in the future.

title: ACDSee 8 was released
---

When I learned to use computer first time, I knew the ACDSee. It was ACDSee 3.1 that time. New ACDSee 8 Photo Manager just released this month. By it, we import, view, organize, print, enhance, share and archive our digital photos. As its predecessor, we also adjust color, brightness and contrast, fix red-eye, rotate, resize and crop images to standard print or screen sizes with its included tool. Generally speaking, it seems that the ACDSee 8 is a valuable software for experiencing. Enjoy it!

title: Google Talk The Instant Messenger by Google
---

![](http://chengbo.net/content/binary/GoogleTalk.png)

Google Talk is a free IM software by Google. It enables we to call or send instant messages to our friends for free anytime, anywhere in the world. Now the Talk is beta version, therefore it is very simple and intuitive to use. All we need to make free calls is an Internet connection, a microphone, and a speaker. After we download the Google Talk, sign in with our Gmail username and password. We can also send an invitation to the people we would like to talk to. Once they accept and download Google TalK, we will be able to talk to them immediately.

My Google account is chengbo1983 AT gmail.com. Welcome everybody to add me as your friend.

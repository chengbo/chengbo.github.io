The "UN 60" design is displayed on the building of the United Nations headquarters in New York, Oct. 22, 2005. Lights in more than 200 offices in the building were turned on to form the "UN 60" sign to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the UN. The world body was established on Oct. 24, 1945.

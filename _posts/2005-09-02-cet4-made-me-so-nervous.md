title: Cet4 made me so nervous
---

I knew I got a mark of 462 in cet4 just now. It satisfied me because I didn't make greate efforts in my Englist study. The passing line doesn't notice now. I don't know whether my score can pass or not, so I worry about this very much.
The score of all sections were just-so-so except composition. It seems that I need more practice. I think English, you know, is one of the most important skills that people need master in modern times. Therefore everybody must attach importance to it both you and me.

Mark of Cet4Total: 462/710  
Listening  comprehension: 104/142  
Reading comprehension: 208/284  
Compositive: 116/178  
Composition: 34/106

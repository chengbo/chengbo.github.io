title: My first English Weblog
---

Ok, so i decided to create my own blog on my site. I installed the Dasblog on my computer last night. Dasblog is a free without restrictions blog application which is developed in C#. It is unlike the Dottext blog application which supports the multi-user mode and uses the MS Sql Server Database. DasBlog is a single-user blog application which uses the XML as its database. MS Sql Server disk space is very expensive, and therefore I wouldn't like to buy it for my own blog. So the Dasblog is the best choice for me. Thank the Dasblog team for their hard working, and hope them moving forward!

This is my first post in this wonderful blog app. I will write post on this web log in English in order to improving my poor English. My English is the worst among all of you, but I know English improvement is a cumulative process. So I will work with perseverance.

I will go to visit my grandparents in Guiyang by train tonight. Long time no see, I miss them so much, it is very cheerful for me that I can visit them again.

It's stiff to finish this post. Thanks Google and Xdict, aha:)
